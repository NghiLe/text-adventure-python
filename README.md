# Text Adventure Game (Python)
This project is a simple text-based adventure game written in Python.  
Players go through the story by making choices, and each choice can lead to a different outcome or ending.

The goal of this project is to practice basic Python programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, and user input, while also building a small interactive game.

## What the game does
- The player is presented with story situations
- At each step, the player chooses what to do next
- Different choices affect how the story continues
- The game can end in different ways depending on the player’s decisions

## What I learned
- Writing Python programs with `if / else` conditions
- Using loops to control game flow
- Using functions (`def`) to break the program into smaller parts
- Handling user input
- Structuring a small program from start to finish

## How to run the game
Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python text_adventure.py
```
## Notes
This project focuses on logic and interactivity rather than graphics or advanced features.
